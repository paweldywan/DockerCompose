# Docker Compose Applications

This repository contains multiple Docker Compose configurations for deploying .NET 8.0 applications with Traefik reverse proxy.

```

## Applications

Each application in `remote/` is a .NET 8.0 ASP.NET application deployed with:

- **Traefik** reverse proxy for routing and SSL/TLS
- **Environment variables** from `.env` files
- **Automatic HTTPS** with Let's Encrypt certificates
- **Domain routing** on `*.paweldywan.com`

## Deployment

Each application requires:

1. `.env` file with configuration variables:
   ```bash
   NAME=AppName
   STACK_NAME=app-name
   ```

2. `app/` folder containing the compiled .NET application

3. Docker networks:
   - `webnet` - External network for Traefik routing
   - `db` - External network for database connections (where applicable)

## Usage

Deploy an application:

```bash
cd remote/<application-name>
docker compose up -d
```

View logs:

```bash
docker compose logs -f
```

Stop an application:

```bash
docker compose down
```

## Security

- All `.env` files and `app/` folders are excluded from version control
- Database connections use internal Docker networks
- SSH tunnel required for database access
- SSL/TLS certificates managed automatically by Traefik

## Networks

- **webnet** - Shared network for all applications and Traefik
- **db** - Shared network for PostgreSQL database access
- **default** - Application-specific internal network

## Requirements

- Docker & Docker Compose
- Access to VPS for deployment
- Domain configured for `*.paweldywan.com`
